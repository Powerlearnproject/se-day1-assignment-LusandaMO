#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Sofware engineering is a structured use of engineering principles to design,develop,test,deploy and maintain high quality software products that are reliable, efficient, scalable, and maintainable.Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of efficient software applications that are used in modern businesses,communications, healthcare,commerce and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements-gathering user needs and system requirements
Design-creating high-level and detailed designs of the sof
Implementation-writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
Testing-conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standardsand functional requirements.
Deployment-Releasing software to users or customers.
Maintenance-Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall
-Sequential and structured approach
-Rigid-changes are difficult to incorporate once the process starts
-Fixed linear phases, flowing downwards like a waterfall
-Longer development cycles, with a fixed timeline

Agile
-Iterative and incremental approach 
-Adaptable and flexible
-Allows and responds to change throughout development
-Shorter cycles (sprints), with frequent releases

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer-Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager-Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software systems

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs and VCS are essential tools in modern software development. IDEs improve productivity and efficiency.They provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA,PyCharm) 

VCS ensures secure, collaborative, and organized coding practices. Using both effectively leads to faster, more reliable, and high-quality software development.It provides tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team memembers. (e.g Git, Subversion, Mercurial)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Changing requirements:customers may frequently change requirements durig development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Proposed Solution:Use Agile methodologies to accommodate changes incrementally. Maintain clear documentation and communication channels to track changes effectively.

-Tight Deadlines:pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
Proposed solution:Using proper project management tools to track progress and breaqking tasks into manageable chunks and set realistic timelines.

-Security Concerns: Software vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches and security risks.
Proposed Solution: Follow secure coding practices, conduct regular security audits, and implement encryption and authentication measures.

-Technical debt:Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, this debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintainance costs.
Solution:effective communication, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goal and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering entails crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.Prompt Engineering helps avoid asking vague question by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Explain photosynthesis."
Improved Prompt: "Explain the process of photosynthesis in plants, covering the role of sunlight, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide, in 300 words."

The improved prompt is more effective because it contains keywords that guides AI towards the kind of response that is wanted. Adding context helps AI to understand the request better
